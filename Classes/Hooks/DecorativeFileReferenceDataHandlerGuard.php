/**
 * Keeps alternative and title empty on decorative file references.
 *
 * This is a data-consistency invariant, not an authorization gate: explicit
 * empty strings prevent FAL from falling back to file metadata, so native
 * f:image/f:media render alt="" for a reference declared decorative. WHO may
 * write tx_mindfula11y_decorative is deliberately governed by core's rules
 * for sys_file_reference alone (table rights, the reference's page
 * permissions, the field's exclude grant) — exactly like the adjacent
 * alternative and title columns. A stricter parent-relation requirement for
 * this one field would be bypassable through those equally powerful core
 * fields anyway and only make permission behavior route-dependent.
 *
 * One addition on top of those core rules: ENABLING decorative additionally
 * requires the alternative and title exclude-field grants. The injected empty
 * strings run through DataHandler's own per-field permission filter, which
 * silently drops fields the user may not write — a partially granted editor
 * could otherwise store the toggle while the blanking is discarded, leaving a
 * decorative reference that still renders its stored alternative text.
